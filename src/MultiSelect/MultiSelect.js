/*
    PART 2 - OPTIONAL 
    
    Develop a component similar to the single select that allows multiple options to be selected. 

    This will include an ability to toggle each option, and then click a submit button for grading.

    Grading will indicate visually on each option if it was correct or not. This implies 4 states for each button - selected and correct, selected and incorrect, not selected and correct, not selected and incorrect.

    The generic feedback shown in the data is binary - either you got it 100% correct and get the correct feedback, or you don't.
